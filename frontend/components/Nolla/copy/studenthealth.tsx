        <h2>HeaLTHcare</h2>
        <p>
          HeaLTHcare in Sweden is (almost) free. You pay a maximum of 300SEK for
          a emergency-visit. However, the way these visits work in Sweden may
          differ from other countries. If you suffer from a low-emergency issue,
          expect other patients to be prioritized over you. Instead, book an
          appointment with your local physician.
        </p>
        <h2>Sirens</h2>
        <p>
          Every three months (March, June, Septermber and December) at 3 sharp
          in the afternoon, Sweden tests its air raid warning by sounding
          sirens. They are evenly distributed on tall buildings throughout
          Sweden. The system has been tested since 1931, meaning all Swedes are
          accustomed to it. The sound of the sirens can however come as a shock
          if you are not prepared for it. So, if you hear the (very audible)
          sirens, do not fear; It&apos;s just a routine test!
        </p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>
          In Sweden we barely use cash anymore; we are moving towards a
          so-called cash-free society. Meaning that you will very rarely be able
          to pay by cash during the nollning. However, most regular stores still
          accept it. It would be wise to check if you have a high fee on card
          transactions while abroad, since it could be a problem for you during
          your first weeks here.
        </p>
        <h2>Guilds versus Nations</h2>
        <p>
          The difference between guilds and nations - what guilds are to LTH,
          nations are to all students at Lund&apos;s University. In order to
          become a member of (and to get involved in) a guild you need to be a
          student at LTH and a member of Teknologkåren. The corresponding
          requirements for nations are that you have to be a student at
          Lund&apos;s University, and a member of Studentlund. You become a
          member of Studentlund when you gain membership at a nation (which is
          free). You can read more about the different nations, what they do,
          and how to get involved at
          <a href="https://wwww.studentlund.se">studentlund.se</a>
          .

        <h2>Student Health Counseling</h2>
        <p>
          If you ever are feeling down, or that you are maltreated at the
          nollning or your time here at LTH, you can to turn to following
          resources:

        <h2>Academic Quarter</h2>
        <p>
          The academic quarter is a concept that exists throughout Lund. The
          academic quarter (15 min) generally means that you start a quarter
          after the set time, but only applies to full hours. So 13:00 means
          13:15 but 16:15 does not mean 16:30. On weekdays after kl. 18.00 and
          on the weekends they talk about double quarters, i.e. 30 minutes. If
          you mean that something actually starts at the appointed time, use the
          term ‘prick’ is abbreviated (.) For academic quarter and the term
          ‘prickprick’ is abbreviated (..) for double quarter.
