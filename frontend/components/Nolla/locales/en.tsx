      text: "A mentor is an older student who often runs around wearing an overall, though some may run around without one. The mentors know an incredible amount of information about LTH, especially how the D-guild and student life work. A mentor knows everything that's on the introduction schedule, where lecture halls are located, how to order pizza, and where to go if you miss the last train home. All mentors have also undergone training in leadership, alcohol responsibility, and much, much more. So don't hesitate to ask them anything if a crisis arises. The mentor is there for your sake.",

      text: "A pepper is a person who assists the organizers of the introduction in their work of planning and carrying out the activities. They often run around wearing pink tailcoats and make sure that both the new students and mentors are excited and have a good time. The peppers also play a significant role in organizing many of the introduction’s events and pre-parties. They know everything about how the introduction works, so if you've missed buying a ticket for a sittning or feel unsure about where and when to attend different events, you can always talk to a pepper!",

This is also your first "school day," but it mainly consists of a tour where you will set up all the accounts you need for your studies, buy your overall, songbook, meet your mentor group, and more. The first big event takes place the day after, on Tuesday, August 22nd, organized by the peppers, so don\'t miss it!',

However, there will be two more weeks of events after the "official" introduction ends on September 15th. During these weeks, there will be more space between events to provide more time for studying. The last event during the introduction period will be held on September 30th.',

Your mentors will also share all important information in your group chat. If you have any questions, you can always ask one of your mentors!',

The introduction is there for you as a new student to find a sense of community in your new education, get to know what student life has to offer, and have a lot of fun, but if you feel that the introduction is not for you or if you simply have other things you'd rather spend your time on, that's completely okay!",

They say time flies when you're having fun, and maybe that's why I still feel young despite being in my 4th year of Computer Science. As the chairman, I lead the board and the guild and represent the section externally. Last spring, I attended no less than 5 (!) balls to represent the guild. When I'm not strolling around in ball gowns, I enjoy cooking and chatting. I love talking about The Witcher (especially the books), my hometown in Blekinge (can you guess which city?), and \"today's economy,\" so don't hesitate to come up to me and say \"Hello World!\"",

          Hey there! I&apos;m Hampus Serneke, and I&apos;m the Vice Chairman
          here at the D-guild. I&apos;m 21 years old and currently in my second
          year of studying Computer Science. I&apos;m a huge math nerd, but when
          I&apos;m not indoors crunching numbers, I also love cycling and
          running (preferably with friends). Carpe diem is my life motto
          (I&apos;ve studied 30 credits of philosophy), so if it&apos;s
          Wednesday, you&apos;ll find me at VGs.
          <br />
          As Vice Chairman, I assist Sofia and the rest of the board with
          various tasks, but one of my responsibilities is to keep records of
          our board and section meetings and keep our governing documents up to
          date. I applied for this position right after the introduction was
          over, and I highly recommend you to do the same! Don&apos;t hesitate
          to come and talk to me if you have any questions. With that said, I
          hope you have an amazing introduction!

          Hey there! Rafael here, from D21. I&apos;m the Head of Activites
          (AktA) and I lead the Activity Committee (AktU). AktU is a committee
          with as many possibilities as there are members in the guild, and we
          organize most of the social events that the section has to offer. We
          come up with all sorts of fun activities, from our own soccer team to
          LAN weekends to selling guild merchandise... you name it, we do it! We
          usually have around 4 events per week, sometimes even more. You can
          find information about what we&apos;re up to on our website (dsek.se),
          the app, and our Instagram @aktivitetsutskottet_dsek. If there&apos;s
          anything you&apos;d like to do, try to find me or drop a message to
          akta@dsek.se, and we&apos;ll figure it out!

          Now, who is Rafael? I grew up in the forests of Blekinge but have
          lived in Norrtälje, Australia, and finally ended up here in Lund. I
          love coming up with new things, and my interests include fitness,
          plants, games, volleyball, mushrooms, hair, traveling, and musicals.
          If we share any of these interests, I&apos;d be thrilled if you catch
          me so we can geek out together.

          you can just drop by for some delightful hanging out. Sometimes, we
