          Beginning your university studies can feel different for everyone.
          Some have just finished high school and are nervous about moving to a
          new city far from home. Others haven&apos;t been in a classroom for
          several years and are anxious about studying math again. Some have
          already been studying for a while and may have just switched to
          Computer Science or InfoCom (Information and Communication), hoping
          that this program will suit them better than the last one.
          <br />
          Regardless of where you come from, you and your new classmates likely
          share similar questions. Will I find friends? Is the education what I
          expected? What if I don&apos;t pass my courses? Unfortunately, neither
          I nor anyone else can answer those questions for you; it&apos;s part
          of the challenge of starting a new education. One thing is certain,
          though, and that is that the years ahead of you will be unforgettable!
          You will learn to overcome challenges you didn&apos;t even imagine
          existed and get to know people you wouldn&apos;t have met otherwise,
          who may become some of your best friends.
          <br />
          Throughout your education, especially during the introduction, The
          D-guild will support you the entire way. We are here for everyone
          studying Computer Science and InfoCom. We provide everything from
          student representation, board game nights, LAN parties, choir singing,
          and carpentry, to parties, trips, and much, much more! Make the most
          of the introduction - learn from your fantastic mentors and enjoy all
          the free food you can. On behalf of the entire guild, I want to
          welcome YOU to the D-guild once again. I wish you the best of luck and
          hope to see you out there!

          The introduction is a term used to describe the first five weeks of
          your time here at LTH. The first of these weeks takes place before
          regular classes begin, and it&apos;s during this time that the
          activities are the most tightly packed. During the days, useful
          introductory courses in various subjects are provided, and in the
          evenings, there are enjoyable activities and parties to participate
          in.
          <br />
          During the initial weeks of coming to a university, one might feel
          nervous or worry about whether they will make any friends or not. This
          is precisely what the introduction is for, as many students come to
          Lund without knowing a single person in the whole city. Based on
          experiences from previous students, people often meet some of their
          closest friends and form entire social circles during the
          introduction.

My tip for an enchanting chili con/sin carne is to season it with cumin and orange zest. To make it even more magical, serve it with rice and a dollop of creme fraiche (not sour cream!!).",

      "Hello in the cabin! I'm Thilda, representing the peppers from above Stockholm and also serving as Equal Treatment Representative for the guild. I'm 26 years young and currently in my third year of studying InfoCom. To have an enchanting introduction from start to finish, my best tip is to attend the events that feel the most fun for you and take the opportunity to rest during others. Stay on top of all upcoming events by checking the calendar, asking a mentor, or finding the nearest pepper! Kisses and hugs!",
    axel: "Hey there! Axel here, also known as Nice (ask, and you might find out why). I've circled the sun 23 times and am heading into my fifth year of studying Computer Science. You'll most likely find me on a dance floor near you or in a gaming chair! To have a magical introduction, I recommend trying to fit in some exercise between all the fun activities. It helps you handle both studies and parties much better!",

          Hi there! I&apos;m Stina, a 21-year-old going into my third year of
          studying Data. My hometown is the lovely Halmstad, known for its
          delicious &apos;Crush&apos; cider and less known for the band Gyllene
          Tider!
        </p>
        <p>
          My most magical introduction tip is to have sunglasses of ALL shapes
          and colors, so you ALWAYS have the coolest shades on the dance floor,
          and they&apos;ll even match your quirky little outfit!! See you on the
          dance floor! &lt;3

A good tip from me is to see if you can find the course literature second-hand, for example, if any of your mentors have their old math books! (It's more fun to spend that money at the bar, where you can often find me!)",
    nora: "Hello there!! I'm Nora, 22 years old, and am studying my third year of InfoCom. My best tip for an enchanting morning is to prepare coffee and breakfast the night before so that you wake up with ZEN and can head to the morning lecture like an academic weapon! Breakfast is, in my opinion, the best meal of the day, stay breakfast stay flawless!!! Hugs and kisses!!",

My best tip for an enchanting introduction is to eat some delicious green salad and listen to hov22 (probably a favorite band or music). But don't take my word for it; I might be biased. P.S. please, GoG don't raise the prices of the salad!!",

              August. This is organized by LTH and is mandatory for all new

            the introduction begins. This is not in any way a method of
            enrolment, it&apos;s just to convey information to you as a newly

        If you ever feel bad or poorly treated during your time at LTH and the
        introduction, there are several places you can turn to for help. Within
        the guild, there is the Well-being Committee which consists of our Head
        of Well-being, Equal Treatment Representatives, Safety Representative,
        and International Representative whi responsible for all international
        matters. Outside the guild, there is also assistance available, such as
        Studenthälsan (Student Health) at Lund University, LTH&apos;s counselors, and
        the student priests (links to these services can be found below). Your
        well-being is essential to us, and we want to offer the safest
        environment possible. So never hesitate to reach out to the organization
        you feel most comfortable with. You can always talk to the people
        responsible at an event or within the leadership of the Introduction
        Committee if you want to talk about anything!

          of the E-building. Since the E-building map in the lobby can be a bit
          difficult to read for newcomers, we have chosen to remove everything
          you probably won&apos;t need to find during your first days here. The most
          common classrooms and locations you will visit are therefore on the
          maps. If you still have trouble finding your way, never hesitate to
          ask one of your mentors; they were once just as confused as you might
          be right now!

        <p>What are the different classrooms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Animal rooms: Classrooms such as E:Falk, E:Hacke, E:Elg. You will
            spend a lot of time here with your programming during tutorial
            sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Planet rooms: Classrooms like E:Jupiter, E:Mars. There will also be
            programming tutorial sessions here.
          </li>
          <li>
            E:A and E:B: The main lecture halls, located by the main entrance. E:C is a
            smaller lecture hall located in the basement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alpha, Beta, and Gamma: Tutorial sessions and labs also take place
            here.
          </li>
          <li>
            iDét: D-guild&apos;s home, where you can study, hang out, grab
            something at the café, attend pubs, and much more!
          </li>
          <li>Edekvata: Like iDét, but for the E-guild.</li>
          <li>
            33xx: Classrooms where seminars, practice sessions, and smaller
            lectures may be held. Also, very good study rooms if they are
            available!
