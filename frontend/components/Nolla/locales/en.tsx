      title: 'What is a mentor?',
      text: 'A mentor is an older student who often runs around wearing an overall, though some may run around without one. The mentors know an incredible amount of information about LTH, especially how the D-guild and student life work. A mentor knows everything that\'s on the introduction schedule, where lecture halls are located, how to order pizza, and where to go if you miss the last train home. All mentors have also undergone training in leadership, alcohol responsibility, and much, much more. So don\'t hesitate to ask them anything if a crisis arises. The mentor is there for your sake.',

      title: 'What is a pepper?',
      text: 'A pepper is a person who assists the organizers of the introduction in their work of planning and carrying out the activities. They often run around wearing pink tailcoats and make sure that both the new students and mentors are excited and have a good time. The peppers also play a significant role in organizing many of the introductionâ€™s events and pre-parties. They know everything about how the introduction works, so if you\'ve missed buying a ticket for a sittning or feel unsure about where and when to attend different events, you can always talk to a pepper!',

    when: {
      title: 'When does the introduction start?',
      text: 'The introduction starts on Monday, August 21st. This is also your first "school day," but it mainly consists of a tour where you will set up all the accounts you need for your studies, buy your overall, songbook, meet your mentor group, and more. The first big event takes place the day after, on Tuesday, August 22nd, organized by the peppers, so don\'t miss it!',

    duration: {
      title: 'How long is the introduction?',
      text: 'The introduction takes place from August 21st to September 15th and concludes with the grand nollegasque, a very special formal sittning that symbolizes the new students becoming first-years. However, there will be two more weeks of events after the "official" introduction ends on September 15th. During these weeks, there will be more space between events to provide more time for studying. The last event during the introduction period will be held on September 30th.',

    bring: {
      title: 'What should I bring to an event? And when should I be there?',
      text: 'All information regarding upcoming events will be available here on the website under the "Schedule" tab and on the introduction app. You will also receive information messages almost every day from those who organize the introduction, so you\'ll know what\'s happening the next day. Your mentors will also share all important information in your group chat. If you have any questions, you can always ask one of your mentors!',

    participate: {
      title: 'Do I have to participate in everything?',
      text: 'Absolutely not! The introduction is completely voluntary, and you can participate as much as you want and feel you have time for. The introduction is there for you as a new student to find a sense of community in your new education, get to know what student life has to offer, and have a lot of fun, but if you feel that the introduction is not for you or if you simply have other things you\'d rather spend your time on, that\'s completely okay!',
